# STAT207 Mini-Project #2 - College Basketball Power Rating Predictor

## Introduction
Welcome to the College Basketball Power Rating Predictor Project! This project aims to build a predictive model that effectively predicts the power rating of a men's college basketball team for new datasets. The core of this project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook.

## Technologies
- **Programming Language:** Python 3
- **Libraries and Frameworks:** Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, Statsmodels
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is from Kaggle's College Basketball Dataset. It includes features such as adjusted offensive efficiency, adjusted defensive efficiency, effective field goal percentage, and more. The dataset was downloaded on March 29, 2024.

- **Dataset Source:** [Kaggle College Basketball Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewsundberg/college-basketball-dataset?resource=download)

## Model
We use various linear regression models, including Ridge and Lasso, to predict the power rating of college basketball teams. The use of these models and tuning are demonstrated in the notebook.

## Installation
To run this project, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that Python 3 and Jupyter Notebook are installed on your machine.
2. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alfredh2/CollegeBasketballPowerRating.git
   ```
3. Navigate to the cloned repository.
4. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the Notebook
1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
2. Start Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
3. Open the `CollegeBasketballPowerRating.ipynb` notebook.
4. Run the cells in the notebook to see the analysis and model predictions.

## Results
The notebook includes a detailed analysis of model performance and accuracy metrics. We compare different models and discuss the best-performing model for this dataset.
